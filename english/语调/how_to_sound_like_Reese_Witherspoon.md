## AMERICAN RHYTHM
* *Hey guys, It's Hadar and this is the Accent's Way and today we're going to talk about American thythm.*
* We already said that American rhythm is derived from the content which means words that are stressed are usually longer and higher in pitch.
* For example, content words like verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs in comparison to words that are less stressed, that are shorter and lower in pitch and softer.
* And these are function words like 'on, in, at, could, would, should, am, is, are, for, of, this, a.'
* *Now if in your language you have a specific stress pattern meaning maybe you stress every other word or maybe you only stress things at the beginning and drop at the end.
* This is a challenge for you and this is why you need to change your mindset and start recognizing the words that you want to stress and these are the words that you want to go for.
* And by 'go for' I mean prolong the main vowel in them and raise the pitch for them.
* And to demonstrate this idea of American intonation and rhythm even further I chose to analyze with you this wonderful speech by Reese Whinerspoon.
* Let's take a look.

---
- What we do now.
- Seriously I'm not kidding.
- Go back and watch any movie and you will see this line over and over again. You're going to see it now.
- Ldies and gentlemen, I think we are in a cultural crisis.
- In every field, and every industry.
- Women are underrepresented and underpaid in leadership positions.
- And the reason we're all talking about it tonight.
- Under 5 percent of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women.

* What do we do now?
* Here she's talking about the fact that almost in every movie there is a point where the woman turns to the man asking "What do we do now?"
* Okay, so let's analyze this question for a sec.
* "What do we do now"
* The two words that stick out the most are 'What' and 'now'. and then we also have 'do'.
* So we have 'what' that is really high in pitch.
* Notice that she's not pushing her voice to say the 'what' and the 'now' she just goes high in pitch.
* "What do we do now?" Right.
* Now of course she's exaggerating and I'm not expecting it to go this high in pitch.
* "What do we do now?" but just try to get the essence of the way she stresses things.
* "What do we do now?" So wuh duh we do, duh we, duh we.
* It's not 'what do we'.
* The 'we' is not reduced but she's saying it really-really quickly.
* "Waht do we do".
* *Right, She's not going higher in pitch but it's longer TA-da-da-da-TA, TA-da-da-da-TA.
* So if you don't want exaggerated so much you can just ask:"What do we do NOW?"
* 'Now' is really long, 'what' is kind of long, 'do' is right there in the middle:TA-da-da-da-TA.
* But the 'do we' is short and somewhat reduced.
* Wuh duh we do now.
* Let's look at the next sentence.
* Seriously I'm not kidding. Go back and watch any movie.
* Seriously, not kidding, any movie, These are the stressed words.
* So she really slows down hitting those stressed words.
* This is not to speechy.
* That's how people actually speak.
* Right. It's a common that she's adding It's not planned I think. Right.
* Seriously I'm not kidding.
* 'Seriously' that's higher in pitch.
* The SE- which is the primary stress is longer than the rest of the syllables: TA-da-da-da.
* And 'I'm not kidding' both the 'not' and the 'kidding' are strssed.
* 'Kidding' is a little more stress than 'not'.
* So it's going to be a little higher in pitch.
* 'go back and watch' 'go back watch' These are three content words but they're not as stressed.
* They're not reduced.
* So we don't reduce the vowel there to a shwa but they're said quickly and softly and with very little effort.
* Go back and watch any movie, right, Slow-slow
* I'm not pushing it.
* I'm not stressing it.
* I'm not necessarily saying it a lot louder, it's just slower.
* it's the distinction between the fast past and the slow part.
* That makes it different, that helps it stick out.
* So it's not just about saying it slowly or strongly or higher in pitch it's also about what I did just before which is I'kinda like reduced it or she did.
* And you see THIS LINE over and over again.
* So first of all listen to the melody.
* Every syllable has a different note.
* "And you will see this line", "and you will" .She didn't reduce it to y'll.
* "And you weill see this line".
* But it's said quickly and effortlessly.
* 'line' is longer.
* 'over and over again' Right? "Again" is reduced.
* Because it's not about the repetition.
* It's about how it happens. every single time.
* This is why she chooses to stress"over and over","over and over again".
* and you will see this line over and over again.
* You're going to see it now.(y'r gonna see it now)
* Now she's not saying "you're going to see it now", You're gonna, you're gonna.
* She's not just reducing it she's going higher in pitch but in this case that doesn't mean that it's stress.
* This is a common pattern where a sentence starts with higher notes.
* "You're gonna see it now" but "see" is the word that sticks out that is longer.
* TA-ta-ra-ta, TA-ta-ta-ta-ta, You're going to see it now.
* See it, uh, uh.
* It's reduced tight.
* It's not 'see it.'
* You're going to see it now.
* I'm always playing with my head voice and my chest voice.
* I'm going up.
* I'm not pushing mu voice.
* You're gonna see it now, right?
* I'm not using more energy ti stress.
* I'm just raising my pitch slightly.
* And if you're not comfertable with going really high in pitch because you get really high pitch when you really wanna stress something you know a little lower in pitch.
* Or you can just prolong the word.
* You're going to see it now.
* that's alse OK.
* But it is different then "You are going to see it now."
* That's the rhythm.
* That's the melody.
* And that's the feel of American English.
* Let's skip to the end of the speech.
* Ladies and gentlemen I think we are in a cultural crisis.
* Now again look at this constant distinction between the fast and the slow the reduced and the stress.
* Ladis and gentlemen, right.
* That's not that important.
* Obviously sht's talking to the ladies and the gentleman in the audience.
* Ladies and gentleman I think we are.
* "I think we are". "Think" is stress it's a little longer.
* "I" is a bit more reduced.
* "I think we are in a cultural crisis is stress it's a little longer."I" is a bit more reduced."I think we are in a cultural crisis".Right.
* So she slows down on the two words "cultural crisis.".
* I think we are in a cultural crisis, right.
* When you really want to stress your point slow down towards the end of the point and then prolong the words that you are stressing.
* I think we are.
* "Think" is alse stressed.
* Ta-ta-ra-TA.Ta-TA-ra-Ta-ta-ra-ta-ta.
* So the words are prolonged but also the pace slows down towards the end.
* Laies and gentlemen I think we are in-a culrutal crisis.
* In ever field, in every industry.
* Now notice the word "in" turns into a shwa.
* She is reducing it. In and in every field.
* So "in" is reduced, "every" is a little longer.
* And "field" that's a stressed word.
* This word is higher in pitch and longer. In every field, in every industry.
* She places it here.
* In every industry.
* So "industry" is a little higher in pitch it's a little longer because she's starting to build up her argument.
* In every field, in every industry.
* And again she slows down ti get our point across to indicate that it's an important part.
* Like I just did now.
* It's an important part you slow down when you reach the important part.
* Women are underrepresented and underpaid in leadership positions.
* So a lot of words are stressed here:
* women, underrepresented, underpaid, leadership positions.Right.
* This is an important sentence, so more words are naturally going to be stressed.
* But here I really want you to see how they come across in comparison to the function words that barely get noticed.
* Women are underrepresented.Ah.Ah.Women are.
* it's not Women are under represented.
* And even in the word underrepresented, there is a distinction between the more important and the less important.
* "Under" is less important. Underrepresented.
* And then the "z" is the primary source so it's going to be higher in pitch and longer than the rest.
* Women are underrepresented an underpaid and then "in leadership positions.".
* So "in" is really really short and reduced.
* It feels like it's part of the word leadership.Leadership.
* In-leadership, in-leadership.
* So you go fron the end to the L you connect them in-leadership positions.
* Notice there is no "o" in the word positions.
* In leadership positions.
* And the reason we're all talking about it tonight
* Ta-ta-Ta-ra-ta-Ta-ta, right.
* And the reason, "radson" is higher in pitch and longer.
* And the reason w-r-all, w-r-all. It's not "we are all".
* "We are" turns into "w-r".
* and it's low in pitch and soft and quick.
* "W'r all" and then we connected to "all".
* So eventually what you get is "w'r-all", w'r-all, w'r-all.
* It's not even "we".
* It's like 'w'r-all', right.
* w-r.
* And the reason we're all talking about it tonight.
* Talking about it tonight.
* The "talking" is important.
* So that's gonna be the peak in terms of the pitch.
* Talking about it tonight.
* Ta-ra-ta-TA.
* So "talking" and "tonight" are important. "about it" is less important.
* So it's gonna be fast and short and kind of reduced.
* Talking about it tonight, talking about it. it-it.
* It's not "talking about it".
* Talking about it tonight.
* Under 5 percent of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women.
* So there are the stressed words, there are the reduced words.
* Third, the stressed words and among them there are words that are more stressed and less stressed.
* So let's look into it.
* "Under 5 percent" taht's stressed because it's slower and higher in pitch.
* Under 5 percent of CEOs.
* Under, that's also reduced.
* 11:54
